# blog_chat_grades_school
 Mini project about interaction between students and their teachers through a blog, a private chat and a view of the grades. Also, teachers con creates posts for the students and create/update their grades. It was made using HTML5, CSS, PHP, Js, MySQL, also it was checked that's still working in Xampp (ver. 8.1.10). To accelerate the process in frontend design, a template was used with the corresponding credits to the designer, adjusting it to the requirements. The project essentially starts from the login page, the main page is only a template but the real project starts in the login page where students and teachers can login with their credentials that are stored in the DB.
